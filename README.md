# Double Tap to the Max app for Hubitat
If you don't want to wait and hold a dimmer paddle while it raises or lowers, this app lets you go to max or min brightness with double-taps.  It was created so that I wouldn't have to create individual Rule Machine rules for every dimmer in my house.  It takes advantage of how most dimmer drivers report double-tapping.  Generally, double-tap up is reported as button 1, and double-tap down is button 2.

## Installation
